note: this is the first time I've worked with CSS, so forgive me for my terrible structure and any inconcistencies that I have left.
please get in touch with me if you find anything off.
# Blackened-Transparency
A discord theme for modified clients featuring transparency with a black tint, pink accents and bubbly elements

Probably has a lot of un-themed elements, please contact me if you've found one!
Even if you think I'll know about it, you should still contact me just in case.

Suggestions? contact me, no suggestion is stupid.

Requires [Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord) by AryToNex and a css injector such as BetterDiscord, EnhancedDiscord, Beautiful Discord, etc (I have only tested this theme with BetterDiscord, though all the class selectors are default discord classes, so it should work with any client, no promises though)
# Examples
![example](https://i.vgy.me/1DEjPL.jpg) Please keep in mind the background in the image is not part of the theme, it is transparent.
# To-Do
Make theme easily customisable

Light theme (maybe)
# Modules
The modules folder contains small themes I'm working on. You can enable these themes with any other themes. and they should work.

Channel list hider - hides the channel list until you hover over the server list.
